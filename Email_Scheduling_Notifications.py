# # Data Processing and Email Notification Pipeline

# This repository contains a Python script for automating a data processing pipeline and sending email notifications with analysis results. The script utilizes various Python libraries to extract data from a source, perform analysis, load data into a database, and send email notifications. Below is the breakdown of the functionality implemented in the script:
# 
# Functionality:
# Data Extraction:
# 
# Extracts data from a specified source.
# The extraction process can be customized based on the source format and access method.
# Data Analysis:
# 
# Analyzes the extracted data to derive insights.
# The analysis process can be tailored according to the specific requirements.
# Data Loading:
# 
# Loads the analyzed data into a SQL database for storage or further processing.
# The loading process involves establishing a connection to the database and inserting the data.
# Email Notification:
# 
# Sends email notifications with analysis results to specified recipients.
# The email content can be customized to include relevant analysis insights.
# Automated Scheduling:
# 
# Utilizes the schedule library to schedule the data processing and email notification tasks.
# The script is scheduled to run at regular intervals (e.g., every 3 days) to ensure timely updates.
# Usage:
# Clone the repository to your local machine:
# 
# bash
# Copy code
# git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
# Navigate to the directory containing the script:
# 
# bash
# Copy code
# cd your_repository
# Modify the script to include your specific data extraction, analysis, and email configuration logic.
# 
# Replace the placeholder email credentials and recipient email address with your actual email details.
# 
# Run the Python script:
# 
# Copy code
# python data_processing_pipeline.py
# Verify that the data processing and email notification tasks are executed as expected.
# 
# Requirements:
# Python 3.x
# Pandas
# Schedule
# smtplib (included in Python standard library)
# email (included in Python standard library)
