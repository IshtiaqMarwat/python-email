    "This repository contains a Python script for automating a data processing pipeline and sending email notifications with analysis results. The script utilizes various Python libraries to extract data from a source, perform analysis, load data into a database, and send email notifications. Below is the breakdown of the functionality implemented in the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality:\n",
    "Data Extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracts data from a specified source.\n",
    "The extraction process can be customized based on the source format and access method.\n",
    "Data Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzes the extracted data to derive insights.\n",
    "The analysis process can be tailored according to the specific requirements.\n",
    "Data Loading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loads the analyzed data into a SQL database for storage or further processing.\n",
    "The loading process involves establishing a connection to the database and inserting the data.\n",
    "Email Notification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sends email notifications with analysis results to specified recipients.\n",
    "The email content can be customized to include relevant analysis insights.\n",
    "Automated Scheduling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizes the schedule library to schedule the data processing and email notification tasks.\n",
    "The script is scheduled to run at regular intervals (e.g., every 3 days) to ensure timely updates.\n",
    "Usage:\n",
    "Clone the repository to your local machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git\n",
    "Navigate to the directory containing the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "bash\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "cd your_repository\n",
    "Modify the script to include your specific data extraction, analysis, and email configuration logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the placeholder email credentials and recipient email address with your actual email details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the Python script:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "python data_processing_pipeline.py\n",
    "Verify that the data processing and email notification tasks are executed as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "Python 3.x\n",
    "Pandas\n",
    "Schedule\n",
    "smtplib (included in Python standard library)\n",
    "email (included in Python standard library)"
